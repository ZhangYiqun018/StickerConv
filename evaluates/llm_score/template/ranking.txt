# Responses for ranking:
{response_list}
- Note: Some responses include the action of sending a sticker. Please assess how the sticker contributes to the empathetic quality of the reply, enhancing empathy towards the user's feelings.

# Evaluation Criteria:
- **Empathy**: Assess the level of understanding, compassion, and emotional intelligence in each response. Pay special attention to how well the sticker (if used) enhances empathy, demonstrating understanding and compassion.
- **Consistency**: Evaluate how well the response maintains logical consistency with the conversation's context, including how stickers complement the message without conflicting with it.
- **Fluency**: Examine the linguistic smoothness and natural flow of the response, ensuring it reads well and is free of grammatical or syntactical errors.
- **Informativity**: Determine the richness and value of the information provided in the response, including whether the sticker adds meaningful emotional or contextual depth to the conversation.

# Ranking Task Instructions:
- Rank the responses based on the criteria above, from best to worst. The best response should excel in empathy, maintain consistency with the conversation, demonstrate fluency in language use, provide informative content, and effectively use stickers for emotional enhancement. The worst response will fall short in these areas.
